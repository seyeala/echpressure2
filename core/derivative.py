"""Derivative estimation utilities.

This module provides several numerical estimators for the first
 derivative of a uniformly sampled time series.  All estimators operate
 on a configurable window ``W`` which represents the number of samples on
 either side of the evaluation point.  Edges where the estimator cannot
 be computed are filled with ``np.nan``.

The implementations favour clarity over performance which is adequate
 for small to medium sized time series used in unit tests.
